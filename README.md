# Applied Statistics - Problems <br /> 
<br /> 
Applied Statistics - Problems contains all the tasks/problems in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course for this module <br /> 
Here I will explain how I came to the solution of given problems, reference the sources I researched for solving the problems and list the technologies I used for creating and testing the code <br />

Software needed to run the Tasks
======

Please see below for the  different tools and packages that I am using for the tasks and anslyses.

- Download Anaconda - Anaconda is a package that aims to simplify package management 
- Download Visual Studio Code
- Jupyer Notebook
- Download Github - https://github.com/AudeAllen/Applied_Statistics.git
- To run the tasks simply click on 'Run all' for tasks.ipynb. The project is a mix of code and markdown blocks which explain each part of each task. You can perform this action either in Visual Studio code or in Anconda in Jupyer Notebook.

Problems
======
### ***problem1 Extending the Lady Tasting Tea***

Let's extend the Lady Tasting Tea experiment as follows.
The original experiment has 8 cups: 4 tea-first and 4 milk-first.
Suppose we prepare 12 cups: 8 tea-first and 4 milk-first.
A participant claims they can tell which was poured first.  

Simulate this experiment using `numpy` by randomly shuffling the cups many times and calculating the probability of the participant correctly identifying all cups by chance.
Compare your result with the original 8-cup experiment.  

In your notebook, explain your simulation process clearly, report and interpret the estimated probability, and discuss whether, based on this probability, you would consider extending or relaxing the p-value threshold compared to the original design.
